Contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When working on an item, create an issue to describe what work you are doing
and assign it to yourself so others know what you are working on. Add it to the
quipucords project and to the appropriate sprint milestone so we can track what
work we get done each sprint.

When making a PR, please request a review from at least on member of the
quipucords/quality-engineers team.

Please squash commits into logical changesets with informative commit messages
before merging. Additionally, rebase onto master and resolve any merge conficts
before merging into master so master can only have fast-forward commits.

Finally, in the last commit of your PR, you can close the issue that describes
the work you are doing in the PR with the phrase "Closes #123" if your issue
was number 123. See the github documentation for more information on this
topic: https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/

If you need help figuring out how to do this, please comment on your PR! We can help or do it for you.
