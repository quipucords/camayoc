Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camayoc only supports Python 3.5 and Python 3.6, so it is recommended that you
install Camayoc into a virtual environment. There are several tools available
for managing virtual environments.

Some resources to learn about virtual environments:

* https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
* http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/


This is a suggested install method:

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the base directory::

    git clone https://github.com/quipucords/camayoc.git
    cd camayoc

2. Create and activate a Python 3.6 virtual environment::

    python3.6 -m venv ~/envs/camayoc
    source ~/envs/camayoc/bin/activate

3. Install using make targets::

    # To install for development, install all dependencies
    make install-dev
    # If you only want to run the test suite, you can skip
    # a few dependencies with the plain "install" target
    make install

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camayoc requires a configuration file to be installed to
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/camayoc/config.yaml``. On most systems this will be
``~/.config/camayoc/config.yaml``.

The config file tells Camayoc about the hosts you would like to run tests
against and the credentials to use with these hosts. It also tells Camayoc
where the quipucords_ server you want to test is running so the tests can
execute against the server.

Camayoc contains test suites for both quipucords/rho and quipucords/quipucords
projects. All portions of the test suite expect the same config file format. 
Any changes to the test suite that require changes to the config file format
should be made with this in mind.

There is an example annotated config file in ``example_config.yaml`` in
the root directory of the Camayoc repository.

Configuring py.test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are testing machines that use ``https`` but do not have good
certificates, it can get difficult to read the test results due to warnings
about insecure connections. If this is a problem for you, an example
``pytest.ini`` file is provided in the root of the ``Camayoc`` repository that
disables these warnings. Additional configuration is possible through the
``pytest.ini`` file, these options are documented at
https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#ini-options-ref

For example, if you always want to run ``py.tests`` in verbose mode, this can
be done in the ``pytest.ini`` file.

Running The Test Suite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While Camayoc  contains test for rho_ and quipucords_, and these share
a config file format, testing both rho_ and quipucords_ simultaneously is
not a supported use case.

Camayoc uses ``py.test`` as its test runner. The pytest project has excellent
documentation available at https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html

Running Tests For rho_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run all the tests for rho_, first have rho_ installed and available in
your ``$PATH``. This can be done by either ``rpm`` install to the system or by
``pip`` installing rho_ from source into your Camayoc virtual
environment. Then invoke the main test suite from the root directory of
Camayoc with::

    make test-rho

There are some additional tests for rho located in
``camayoc/tests/remote/rho`` that scan all machines listed in the
``inventory`` section of the config file (see ``example_config.yanl``)
with all available network credentials. To run these, you similarly
invoke::

    make test-rho-remote

Running Tests For quipucords_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run all the quipucords_ tests, first start the quipucords_ server
and set up your config file to point to the server. You should also
install the qpc_ executable in such a way that it is available in your
``$PATH``. Then run all API, CLI, and UI tests with::

    make test-qpc

.. warning::
    There are extra considerations you must take if you are running the
    quipucords server in a container.  First, your config file must use
    paths for sshkeys that exist on the server.
    Additionally you must map your ``/tmp`` directory to the server's ``/tmp``
    directory  because some tests create temporary files in ``/tmp`` that
    must be accessed by the server.

To only test the API, CLI, or UI, you can take advantage of the
following make targets::

    # for API tests only
    make test-qpc-api
    # for CLI tests only
    make test-qpc-cli
    # for UI tests only
    make test-qpc-ui

Additionally you can select tests based on string matching. For
example, to run quipucords tests with ``create`` in the name and skip
any others, run::

    make test-qpc PYTEST_OPTIONS="--verbose -k create"

Any other valid pytest options may be included as well in this
variable.

By default scans defined in the config file are run at the beginning of the test session and results are cached to be used by other tests. This causes there to be some latency between when the test session begins and tests begin reporting results. If you want to run a test quickly without running the scans, you can include the environment variable ``RUN_SCANS=False`` in your ``py.test`` invocation. There is also a make target that provides this functionality::

    # Runs all tests except ones that require results of scanjobs
    
    make test-qpc-no-scans

    # You can do this manually as well
    # For example, if I just want to run a few login/logout
    # This would just run those without the scans running first.
    
    RUN_SCANS=False py.test camayoc/tests/qpc/api/v1/authentication/

Testing Camayoc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Testing Camayoc requires that you have installed the development dependencies. Do that by running ``make install-dev``.

To run all checks of the Camayoc test framework, including testing the docs
build, run::

    make all

The doc strings of each test case are designed to be digested by sphinx_. It is a good idea when writing new tests to make sure the doc strings are rendering as you expect them to. To make and serve the docs on your local machine::

    make docs-serve
