Documentation for developers
============================

This is Camayoc development documentation.
It is mostly generated manually by actual human beings.
While still not a gospel, it allows to focus on things that would be easy to miss in automatically generated documentation and gives space to discuss things that go beyond the scope of package API (i.e. "Why?", instead of only "What?" and "How?").
