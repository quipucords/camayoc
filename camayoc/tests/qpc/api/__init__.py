"""Tests for Quipucords server.

This package and its sub-packages contain functional tests for quipucords
server. These tests should be run against QPC installations.

QPC is interacted with over its API, and the base url should be specified in
your camayoc config file. You can find a sample config file in the root of the
repository named ``example_config.yaml``.

Be sure to specify the port if you are running on a non-standard one.
